# VeryLeakyCauldron
VeryLeakyCauldron is a specialized app designed to simulate memory leaks in a controlled environment. It is primarily intended for engineering training and for testing the robustness of monitoring systems. By intentionally causing memory leaks, users can evaluate how well their systems detect and handle such scenarios.
